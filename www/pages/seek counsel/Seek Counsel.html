                    <h2>Emotional Abuse</h2>
                    <p>Emotional abuse is very difficult to treat unless the victim distances themselves from the abuser or the abuser agrees there is a problem and attends therapy in order to try to cease the abusive behavior. However, for this to happen, the abuser needs to understand that it’s a problem which is difficult in the case of emotional abuse.</p>

                    <h2>Psychological Abuse</h2>
                    <p>Emotional abuse can be difficult to identify if it is not blatant. Some people excuse their abuser’s behavior, blaming it on a bad mood. Since emotional abuse often causes low self-esteem, the person may think they deserve their poor treatment. If someone experiences gaslighting, they may even believe they imagined the abuse.</p>
